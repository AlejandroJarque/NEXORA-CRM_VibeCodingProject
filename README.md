 **Vibe Coding Project** 

  Nexora was built intentionally using AI-assisted development (vibe coding) as an experiment to explore how far you can go with AI tools when you have a solid programming foundation. The architecture, decisions and code quality were guided by that knowledge, but the implementation was generated with artificial intelligence.

# NEXORA CRM

## Architecture

The application is structured around a layered architecture inspired by Domain-Driven Design (DDD):

### Controllers (HTTP Layer)

* Handle incoming HTTP requests
* Validate request intent and format
* Delegate business logic to the Application layer
* Return standardized JSON responses

### Application Layer

* Contains use cases and services
* Coordinates domain logic
* Acts as an intermediary between Controllers and Domain logic

### Domain Layer

* Represents the core business logic
* Contains domain events and entities
* Is independent of framework-specific details

### Infrastructure

* Database access via Eloquent ORM
* Authentication and authorization mechanisms
* Configuration and environment setup

## Authentication

Authentication is handled using token-based security suitable for REST APIs.

* OAuth2-based authentication using Laravel Passport
* Users authenticate via a login endpoint
* A valid access token is required to access protected endpoints
* Tokens are sent using the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

This approach ensures the API remains stateless and secure.

## Database Design

The database is intentionally simple and normalized. It consists of the following main entities:

* **Users**: Application users who authenticate and perform actions
* **Clients**: Customers managed by users
* **Contacts**: People associated with a client
* **Activities**: Actions or events associated with a client

Relationships:

* A User can have many Clients
* A Client belongs to a User
* A Client can have many Contacts
* A Contact belongs to a Client
* A Client can have many Activities
* An Activity belongs to both a Client and a User

Migrations and seeders are provided to simplify setup and local development.

## API Documentation

Swagger UI is available at:

* **Production**: https://crm-nexora.onrender.com/swagger/index.html
* **Local**: http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html

The OpenAPI specification is located at `backend/public/openapi.yaml`.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

* Docker Desktop
* Git

### With Docker (recommended)

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlejandroJarque/CRM_APIrest.git
cd CRM_APIrest
```

2. Copy environment file
```bash
cp backend/.env.docker backend/.env
```

3. Start containers
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

4. Run migrations and seeders
```bash
docker exec crm_app php artisan migrate --seed
```

5. Create Passport personal access client
```bash
docker exec crm_app php artisan passport:client --personal --no-interaction
```

Backend available at: `http://localhost:8080`  
Frontend available at: `http://localhost:5173`  
API Docs available at: `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html`

### Without Docker

#### Backend

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlejandroJarque/CRM_APIrest.git
cd CRM_APIrest/backend
```

2. Install PHP dependencies
```bash
composer install
```

3. Copy environment configuration and generate key
```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

4. Configure database credentials in `.env`

5. Run migrations and seeders
```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
php artisan passport:client --personal --no-interaction
```

6. Start the development server
```bash
php artisan serve
```

#### Frontend

1. Install dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Copy environment file
```bash
cp .env.development .env
```

3. Start the dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend available at: `http://localhost:5173`

## Environment Variables

### Backend (.env)
```env
APP_ENV=local
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost:8080

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=crm
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password

FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### Frontend (.env.development)
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

## Deployment

The application is deployed on [Render](https://render.com):

* **Backend** — Web Service running a Docker container. On every deploy: migrations run automatically, Passport keys are generated, and the application cache is cleared.
* **Frontend** — Static Site. Built with `npm run build` and served as a static bundle.

### Production environment variables

#### Backend
```env
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://crm-nexora.onrender.com
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
FRONTEND_URL=https://nexora-frontend-ng73.onrender.com
```

#### Frontend
```env
VITE_API_URL=/api
```

## Running Tests
```bash
docker exec crm_app php artisan test
```

Current test suite: **101 tests, 238 assertions**.

## Git Workflow

This project follows **Gitflow**:

* `main` — production-ready code, tagged releases
* `develop` — integration branch
* `feature/*` — new features
* `fix/*` — bug fixes
* `release/*` — release preparation

All commits follow conventional prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`.

## Development Notes

* Controllers are kept thin and focused on HTTP concerns
* Business logic is encapsulated in service classes
* Domain events decouple side effects from core logic
* The codebase follows Laravel and REST best practices
* The project is designed to be easily extendable

## Events

The project includes support for domain events and notifications:

* Domain events are triggered on relevant actions (e.g. client creation, activity registration)
